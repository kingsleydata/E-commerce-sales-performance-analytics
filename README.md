# E-commerce-sales-performance-analytics

## Project Overview

### 
**Why is it important to analyze sales performance and customer behavior for any e-commerce business?**

Understanding customer behavior and sales performance is essential for driving sustainable growth in any e-commerce business. This project was undertaken to transform raw transaction data into actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making in areas such as marketing strategy, customer retention and revenue optimization.

**What was my analysis focused on?:**

My analysis focused on both foundational and advanced performance metrics. Core KPIs included **total revenue**, **unique customers** and **average order value (AOV)**. To gain deeper insights, the project also explored:

* **Revenue trends** using a 3-month rolling average
* **Repeat purchase rate** overall and by product
* **Average customer lifetime value (CLV)**
* **Average customer acquisition cost (CAC)**
* **Monthly customer acquisition rate trends**
* **Average time between a customer's first and second order**

###### These metrics were used to assess the effectiveness of customer acquisition strategies, customer retention patterns, and product loyalty. The end result is a comprehensive snapshot of the e-commerce business's health and a guide for strategic planning and effective decision making.

## Core metrics and their implications

#### Revenue trend by month and quarter

###### The 3 month moving average (trend) for revenue saw a huge spike between September and November, this might be indicative of seasonal demand for certain products, general business growth due to better marketing or exceptional products and services being provided to customers hereby making them come back for more. 

###### There was also consistent growth in revenue from Q1 2011 till Q4 2011 as ween below.

###### Since the United Kingdom accounts for approximately 85% of the business's total revenue over the tracked period, a 36% increase in revenue from the UK between Q3 and Q4 is a strong indicator of overall business growth as seen below.

#### Customer acquisition metrics

##### There was a steady drop in customer acquisition rate between March 2011 and August 2011 followed by a turn around in September 2011, this is possibly due to reduced marketing effectiveness, market saturation or increased competition as seen in chart above.

##### However, a strong repurchase rate suggests that existing customers are highly engaged and loyal as seen in chart below.

##### While high retention is a great thing, long term growth can be stalled if customer acquisition rate keeps dropping.

##### What should be done? 
-   ###### Review and optimize marketing efforts (reallocate marketing spend to acquisition channels bringing in more users/customers.
-   ###### Launch affiliate programs for current customers and offer benefits to current customers for referring others to the business.

##### How long after a user's first purchase are they likely to repurchase, this was tracked for each quarter and there was a steady downtrend 
##### in retention after first purchase which is great for retention.

#### Repurchase rate by product

![Product repurchase rate](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/229f35e9-910a-4530-b81f-4dd77f159daf)

###### Some products have a very high repurchase rate as seen in the chart above, what should be done about this?

- ###### These products should be prioritized during marketing campaigns
- ###### These products should be used to attract new customers to the business.
- ###### These products should be cross sold with similar products so products with low repeat purchase or low sales can get a boost.
- ###### Ensure to prevent stockouts for these products by constantly tracking inventory.

#### Recommendations 

- ##### Revamp new user acquisition strategies for the business.
- ##### Leverage high demand products to drive acquisition and loyalty among customers.
- ##### Run surveys on the website to see what customers truly feel about products with very low repurchase rate and adjust accordingly or retire product entirely.
- ##### Keep track of the UK market since it is the cash cow of the business but find ways to attract customers from other countries in order to reduce dependency.
