# E-commerce-sales-performance-analytics

## Project Overview

### 
**Why is it important to analyze sales performance and customer behavior for any e-commerce business?**

Understanding customer behavior and sales performance is essential for driving sustainable growth in any e-commerce business. This project was undertaken to transform raw transaction data into actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making in areas such as marketing strategy, customer retention and revenue optimization.

**What was my analysis focused on?:**

My analysis focused on both foundational and advanced performance metrics. Core KPIs included **total revenue**, **unique customers** and **average order value (AOV)**. To gain deeper insights, the project also explored:

* **Revenue trends** using a 3-month rolling average
* **Repeat purchase rate** overall and by product
* **Average customer lifetime value (CLV)**
* **Average customer acquisition cost (CAC)**
* **Monthly customer acquisition rate trends**
* **Average time between a customer's first and second order**

These metrics were used to assess the effectiveness of customer acquisition strategies, customer retention patterns, and product loyalty. The end result is a comprehensive snapshot of the e-commerce business's health and a guide for strategic planning and effective decision making.
