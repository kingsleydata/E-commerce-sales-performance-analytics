# E-commerce-sales-performance-analytics

## Project Overview

### 
**Why is it important to analyze sales performance and customer behavior for any e-commerce business?**

Understanding customer behavior and sales performance is essential for driving sustainable growth in any e-commerce business. This project was undertaken to transform raw transaction data into actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making in areas such as marketing strategy, customer retention and revenue optimization.

**What was my analysis focused on?:**

My analysis focused on both foundational and advanced performance metrics. Core KPIs included **total revenue**, **unique customers** and **average order value (AOV)**. To gain deeper insights, the project also explored:

* **Revenue trends** using a 3-month rolling average
* **Repeat purchase rate** overall and by product
* **Average customer lifetime value (CLV)**
* **Average customer acquisition cost (CAC)**
* **Monthly customer acquisition rate trends**
* **Average time between a customer's first and second order**

These metrics were used to assess the effectiveness of customer acquisition strategies, customer retention patterns, and product loyalty. The end result is a comprehensive snapshot of the e-commerce business's health and a guide for strategic planning and effective decision making.

## Core metrics and their implications

#### Revenue trend by month and quarter

The 3 month moving average (trend) for revenue saw a huge spike between September and November, this might be indicative of seasonal demand for certain products, general business growth due to better marketing or exceptional products and services being provided to customers hereby making them come back for more. 

There was also consistent growth in revenue from Q1 2011 till Q4 2011 as ween below.

###### Since the United Kingdom accounts for approximately 85% of the business's total revenue over the tracked period, a 36% increase in revenue from the UK between Q3 and Q4 is a strong indicator of overall business growth as seen below.

#### Customer acquisition metrics

##### There was a steady drop in customer acquisition rate between March 2011 and August 2011 followed by a turn around in September, this is possibly due to reduced marketing effectiveness, market saturation, or increased competition as seen in chart above.

##### However, a strong repurchase rate suggests that existing customers are highly engaged and loyal as seen in chart below.

##### While high retention is a great thing, long term growth can be stalled is customer acquisition rates keep dropping.
